# stharrold.github.io

GitHub page for stharrold, [Data Science Demos](https://stharrold.github.io), with source code (`src_*` branches).  

## Building

This repository contains both the source code for the GitHub page and the output generated by [`pelican`](http://blog.getpelican.com/). The page served by GitHub is the `master` branch, which is managed using [`ghp-import`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ghp-import). The `src_*` branches are managed using [`git-flow`](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

How to build the site for development:
```bash
$ git checkout src_develop
$ pelican --settings pelicanconf.py
$ cd output
$ python -m http.server 8000 &
$ # View the page at http://localhost:8000
```

How to build the site for deployment:
```bash
$ git checkout src_master
$ pelican --settings publishconf.py
$ ghp-import output -b master -p
$ # View the page at https://stharrold.github.io
```
