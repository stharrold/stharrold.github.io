## Overview

In October 2015, I bought a Chromebook with the intent of moving my data-science development workflow to the cloud. This is the workflow that I've settled on so far:[^1]

## Step-by-step

## Why __?

### IPython Notebooks

[IPython (Jupyter) Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) enable me to
develop quickly and to share my work in-progress. The notebook serves as a top-level script, the parts of which I eventually modularize as components of installable packages.
